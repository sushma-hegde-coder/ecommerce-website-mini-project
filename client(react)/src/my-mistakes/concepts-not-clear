setState where can be used? --------inside lifecycle methods, after event trigger call a function and use setState inside that
you can't change the props inside the component you are using it, you can only use it 

onClick={()=>{ console.log(); func()}  }            //can do any js code inside onClick need not be a single line 

total Amount not able to pass as prop, it should be taken from ProductList pass to Product then to cart..passing at same level not possible
 ---sould I use redux?

 onSubmit={()=>Home()} can't you call a component after submitting a form ? should use history.push ?
